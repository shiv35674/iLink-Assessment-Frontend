# InsuranceApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.2.

Below is the screenshot of the application and the instructions to run it. I have included Toastr package that pops a success or error message on different events i.e., Login in, Adding a payment method, Editing or Removing existing payment methods. I have also included parent-to-child as well as child-to-parent relationship. Payment component is the parent and payment detail component is the child. In the payment component you can perform CRUD operations. One user can have more than one policy too.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
